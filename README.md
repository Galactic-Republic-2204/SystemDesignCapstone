# Front-End-Capstone

## **Description**

We designed an e-commerce website with user-friendly interfaces to reflect the nested product data retrieved from the API, with a local server to post and get requests.  

The webpage mainly consists four sections: Product Overview, Related Products and Outfit, Questions and Answers, and Ratings and Reviews.
